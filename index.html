        <h2>Snakes</h2>
        <p>Snakes are among the most misunderstood of all animals. As a result, many harmless, beneficial snakes have
            met untimely deaths at the hands of shovel-wielding humans. Of the dozen or so species of snakes found in
            Washington, only the Western rattlesnake is capable of inflicting a venomous bite, which it seldom does.

        <h2>Turtles</h2>
        <p>This turtle appears to be common in Washington and no specific conservation actions seem needed at this time;
            however, identifying where native populations actually occur is useful.</p>

        <h2>Insects</h2>
        <p>Did you know that insects pre-date humanity (as well as the dinosaurs) by millions of years? This video
            illustrates molting and metamorphosis and explores insect behavior and anatomy-from the six-legged
            configuration that all insects share to fascinating facts about vision, pheromones, feeding, flight, social
            organization, and more.</p>
